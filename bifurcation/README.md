The geometry is obtained from ultrasound scanning of a human carotid bifurcation, after smoothing and surface reconstruction using the two tools:
1. MyCrustOpen --surface reconstruction from scattered surface point cloud. 
2. smoothpatch --surface smoothing using diffusion flow algorithm. You must have C++ compiler installed to use this tool.
