# Lattice-Boltzmann-Method-GPU
This program is a GPU CUDA version D3Q19 BGK Lattice Boltzmann Method Computational Fluid Dynamics solver to simulate steady/unsteady 3D single-phase flows. Compared with CPU serial code, this GPU code is more than 200 times faster and has same accuracy. To run it, a NVIDIA GPU with CUDA Toolkit is a must
